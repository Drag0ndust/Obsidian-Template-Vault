# Obsidian Template Vault

An template vault for people using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

If you're new to Obsidian, I'd recommend just using it without any plugins or configs. Just get familiar with the interface as a Markdown editor and linking things.

Once you're more acclimated to it, then feel free to take pieces of inspiration from the boilerplate!

## Setup the vault

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. [Download](https://github.com/Drag0ndust/Obsidian-Template-Vault/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone a fork of this repo
3. Open Obsidian and you should see a prompt like below:

4. Click on the `Open` button next to "Open folder as vault"
5. Select the folder you've downloaded / cloned from Step #2.
6. When prompted with "Safe Mode," select `Turn off Safe Mode` which will enable you to utilize the third party plugins that are critical to this starter kit
7. You should be prompted with the "Preferences" pane, if not, you can open it by selecting the Settings (Cog) icon in the bottom left corner, or opening it with `Cmd + ,` (macOS) / `Ctrl + ,` (Windows)

8. Go to "Community Plugins"
9. Ensure all "Installed Plugins" by are enabled. If not, toggle the switch on each one to turn everything on
10. And you're good to go!
